              Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

* Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
* Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
* Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
* Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
